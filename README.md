# Regression Model Solutions

This project provides a complete pipeline for building, training, evaluating, and visualizing regression models, specifically Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kaurrmanpreett/Regression_model_solutions.git

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
